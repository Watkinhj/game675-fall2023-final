DESIGN INFO: 
From Below - 2d Platformer, the player wakes up in a facility deep underground, and has to discover how the outside world came to an end. Win condition is exiting the facility. 
(Is the outside world actually dead? Maybe it’s fine, or maybe it’s lush and green because there are no humans around? Is there another species inhabiting the planet? Just ideas to toss around)
What if the player sees this and determines that it’s uninhabitable (IE they don’t know that plants and foliage and shit is how the world is supposed to be)
Text log narratives


Robots/computers you can interact with for story
Dialogue choices 
Central twist
The player can pick up optional gear that assists them in their mission
This gear can only be powered by an energy source in the vault, does not exist outside the vault
Vault door closes and locks once the player leaves to prevent ‘contamination’; cannot be opened from the outside
If they have too much cybernetics installed, the player cannot survive on the surface. Bad ending.
If they have no or a small amount of cybernetics installed, the player survives. Good ending.

WORLD STORY: 
In the past, humanity was facing complete and utter extinction. Changes in weather patterns and upsurges in volcanic activity were already spelling doom for the planet, and extreme political turmoil over the circumstances pointed towards an all-out apocalyptic war. Earth would become completely uninhabitable for human life.

The company “(come up with a name lol)”, foreseeing these events, created a contingency measure to try and preserve humanity. They created a series of deep underground bunker facilities to house large groups of humans in hopes that, eventually, the earth would be habitable once more.

Once a facility was filled and prepared to be locked for the future, all inhabitants, man and animal alike, would enter cryogenic stasis. They would sleep through the apocalyptic event, and wake up after a set amount of time. (ranging from 1,000 - 10,000 years.) During the sleeping process, various autonomous robot helpers would manage and upkeep the facility to ensure the survival of the sleeping humans, and that the facility would be prepared in the event that the humans needed to stay inside for longer than expected.

In addition to cryogenic storage, the facilities come equipped with:
	A Command Center
For managing general facility operations, communications with other facilities, and tracking how much time has passed. 
	General Housing
Housing for humans outside of cryosleep.
	Hydroponics
For growing food and maintaining oxygen supply
Engineering/Research Labs
For upkeep of robots and cyberware
	Medical Station
For general medical purposes and cyberware installations
	General Recreational Areas
For human activities outside of cryosleep
	Power Core
For Power management and upkeep	

In addition, the facility is set to allow specific people outside of sleep early to do various human-only management and upkeep tasks. In the event that something goes wrong, and the individual chosen to wake up early to complete these tasks does not wake from cryogenic sleep, another random person is chosen to wake up instead. In this case, the chosen individual is allowed to install various cyberware implants to assist them in the completion of their tasks.

However, for safety reasons, these cyberware implants primarily operate based on their own power system, and need to be recharged for extended use. Thankfully, the facility comes equipped with a localized “wireless” electrical system to ensure basic human functionality with cyberware installed, with various charging stations allowing the user to charge specific aspects of their cyberware. NOTE: Cyberware implants will NOT be fully operational outside of the facility, as there is no localized energy source to keep the implants charged. 

In the event that the cyberware has no local charge, it will draw from the user’s own bodily energy. Though, this should not be a problem with the use of minimal cybernetic implants, and the energy drawn won’t be lethal. Since chosen workers will only typically require one implant to complete their tasks, this isn’t seen as an issue. 

In the event that someone is required to exit the facility, they must acquire biological access from the command center. For safety reasons, once a person or animal leaves the facility, they are not allowed back inside. 

THE PLAYER’S STORY:
You wake up from cryogenic sleep, in a dark and barely lit facility. You traverse through the facility, discovering that, strangely, all other cryopods are closed. Did the others not wake up? Were you chosen to complete various tasks instead? 

You navigate through the recreational and housing area. (Getting used to the basic controls)

Upon reaching the main area, a robot informs you that, because the primary maintenance personnel did not wake from cryosleep, you were chosen to complete the maintenance tasks instead. 
Your tasks are:
	Perform a routine manual reset of the power core.
	Manage plant overgrowth and perform a full hydroponic recycle
	Perform maintenance on the damaged and malfunctioning robot in engineering.
Once you are finished with your tasks, you are to report to the command center.

The robot introduces you to the medical station, which the player can use to install or remove cybernetic implants. You are offered a thruster pack implant (double jump) to assist with their tasks. 

POWER CORE:
When you reach the power core, you find that the core is completely out of control, with various fluctuations affecting the entire room. Electrical hazards are everywhere. You must navigate to the central core to perform a full reset. Within the room, you find a magnetic boot implant (wall climb/wall jump). When you reach the end, you reset the core. The core tells you that the last core reset was not for [ERROR] years. You can also find a command keycard somewhere in the room.

HYDROPONICS:
When you reach hydroponics, you find that the room is entirely overgrown with plant life. Within the room, you find an industrial knife implant (melee attack). You must traverse the overgrown rooms, cutting away plant life. Once you reach the end, you activate the hydroponic recycle. You can also find a command keycard somewhere in the room.

ENGINEERING: 
When you reach Engineering, you find that it is littered with malfunctioning and dead robots. You also find a monowire implant (grappling hook). You must make your way through engineering, fighting through (or avoiding) malfunctioning robots that see you as a threat. Once you reach the end, you begin to repair the broken engineering robot. The robot tells you that it can now begin its own repairs on the other robots. You also snag a command keycard hidden somewhere in the room.

OTHER: 
You can also find various logs, scraps, and robots through the facility that will tell you about the facility’s normal functionalities, and what happened to the outside world before you went to sleep. You will also be provided hints to the functionality of your cyberware, and how it affects your body.

COMMAND: 
You must navigate through one big level, combining all the skills you’ve learned up to this point. Once you reach command, you:
	Inform it that you have completed your tasks. 
The computer will tell you “job well done”, and will allow you to return to cryosleep. (NEUTRAL ENDING)
	(IF YOU HAVE ALL THE COMMAND CARDS) Insert the command keycards.
The computer goes into command override, and tells you various things:
The facility has had many errors over the centuries, resulting in catastrophic failure in several areas:
You were the only person to successfully wake from cryosleep, after trying to wake literally every other person. It is a miracle that you are even alive.
It has been 12,000 years since everyone went into cryosleep (2,000 years over the max allotted time)
Because it has been so long, you are now allowed to choose whether or not you want to exit the facility. (NEUTRAL ENDING: Remain in the facility)

EXITING THE FACILITY:
Should you choose to exit the facility, the door locks behind you. You walk outside, and find that the world is sunny and green. You start to walk. 
CYBERWARE CHECK:
If you have THREE OR MORE cybernetic implants, the charge will start to wear off, and your body’s energy will start to be drained. You collapse on the ground. (BAD ENDING)
If you have TWO OR LESS cybernetic implants, you keep walking across the grass field, and see a city off in the distance. You walk offscreen, ready to start your new life. (GOOD ENDING)
